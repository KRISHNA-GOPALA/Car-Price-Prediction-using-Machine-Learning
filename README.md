# Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview  
This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts the price of used cars based on key features such as age, fuel type, seller type, and transmission. The model is trained using **Linear Regression** and **Lasso Regression**.

## Features  
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Encoding categorical features  
- Training and evaluating regression models  
- Visualizing predictions and model performance  

## Installation  
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-price-prediction.git
```
```bash
cd car-price-prediction
```
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to:

1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Train machine learning models.
3. Evaluate performance and make predictions.

## Dependencies
See requirements.txt for required packages with versions.

## Dataset
The dataset should be in CSV format and contain the following columns:
- Year
- Selling_Price
- Present_Price
- Kms_Driven
- Fuel_Type
- Seller_Type
- Transmission
- Owner

## License
This project is open-source and can be modified as needed.
